```lrc
[00:25.93] When the rain is blowing in your face
[00:32.18] And the whole world is on your case
[00:38.31] I could offer you a warm embrace
[00:44.44] To make you feel my love
[00:56.44] 
[00:50.62] When the evening shadows and the stars appear
[00:56.81] And there is no one there to dry your tears
[01:03.26] I could hold you for a million years
[01:09.16] To make you feel my love
[01:21.16] 
[01:15.45] I know you haven't made your mind up yet
[01:21.71] But I would never do you wrong
[01:28.07] I've known it from the moment that we met
[01:33.72] No doubt in my mind where you belong
[01:51.72] 
[01:40.69] I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
[01:47.03] I'd go crawling down the avenue
[01:53.32] Know there's nothing that I wouldn't do
[01:59.17] To make you feel my love
[02:11.17] 
[02:30.29] The storms are raging on the rolling sea
[02:36.50] And on the highway of regret
[02:42.71] The winds of change are blowing wild and free
[02:48.52] You ain't seen nothing like me yet
[03:05.52] 
[02:54.72] I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
[03:01.70] Nothing that I wouldn't do
[03:07.89] Go to the ends of the earth for you
[03:13.96] To make you feel my love
[03:25.96] 
[03:20.26] To make you feel my love
